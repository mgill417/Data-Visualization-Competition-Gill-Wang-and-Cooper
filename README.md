# 2024 Data Visualization Competition- NWRM Region. 
A key outcome of interest in the Northwest & Rocky Mountain (NWRM) region is "Supporting Right-Size Investing and Infrastructure". This outcome seeks to address gaps in the understanding of needs between funders and small to mid-sized producers. Specifically, the NWRM RBC hopes to identify which types of investment encourage development of the regionâ€™s food systems in order to propose well-researched investments to funders. To that end, the goal of this visualization is to improve access to capital in the NWRM region by identifying factors that contribute to the development of local food systems, and where opportunity exists for counties of various rurality levels. To achieve this, we focus on the following indicators:
1. **Local Food Sales in All Counties of the NWRM Region**: Indicates the economic activity and performance of food businesses within the region; a measure of local food system development.
2. **Estimators of Local Sales in the NWRM Region**: Identifies key factors driving local sales, guiding effective investments. County-level variables include: the number of local food sellers, the count of meat processing institutions (MPI), and the rural/urban dimension of the county.
3. **Producer Equity and Food Access Indicators in the NWRM Region**: Includes the number of BIPOC producers per county and the percentage of the population with low food access, ensuring investments promote inclusivity and accessibility.

## Note about Code Files in July 19 Deliverables Folder

*Note, this project had several authors with various strengths. As such, we used two code files:

*Pt. 1. Stata .do File code of data scraping and organization, ending with an excel export. 
*Pt. 2 RMD file of data visualization, beginning with a title and subsequent {r setup}. Ends with a pdf export. 

We have also compiled these into one .rtf document. 

## Note about raw data file: The data file was too large to upload to github, but the dropbox source from the USDA Data Warehouse is: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zpxmg4ka2j7iol1bxrtsn/AO96kkZEZxNww3kFw4HVvVM/data_final?e=5&preview=df_localfoodsales.csv&rlkey=172aq18oknqbct2d5rjm9n1xl&subfolder_nav_tracking=1&dl=0 


# USDA AMS - Data and Metrics

The Data and Metrics initiative is focused on fostering greater data efficacy and literacy across local and regional food systems by engaging project stakeholders in completing a gap analysis of existing local and regional food system data, fostering peer mentorship, and providing technical assistance. In part to accomplish these goals, teams of researchers and community partners reviewed and compiled available data using an equity lens into a single data warehouse to facilitate analysis and visualization.

The initiative first began by reviewing the mission statements from national local and regional food system network leaders. Mission statements were organized into six categories -- labor, farm development/local food sales, business development/food infrastructure, community wealth/well-being, nutrition security/food access, and policy. For each of the categories, except for policy, the teams created document briefs identifying key related data indicators available nationwide at the county level. Creators of data warehouses, data explorers, and data dashboards encounter several challenges when it comes to the issue of equity. Reliance on existing data limited the ability to disaggregate data by dimensions of race, ethnicity, and citizenship status. As a result, we encourage the use of practices that invite community members to help contextualize data, share their personal stories, and amplify community solutions. The data warehouse is open-source and additional contributions are welcome, see below.

## Goals of the Project

-   Support the utilization of data in program evaluation and decision making.

-   Improve access to data from an array of sources including government, NGOs, network partners, and researchers.

## Data contributions

We will accept suggestions of data to add to our data repository and website. Please follow instructions, as described on [localfoodeconomics.com](https://localfoodeconomics.com/data/recommendations/), to submit a request to add data.

Accepted data contributions will be added one time per year. Visit [localfoodeconomics.com](https://localfoodeconomics.com/data/recommendations/) for criteria used to accept or reject suggestions.

## Data and code

A detailed description of the project and all of the data, including code, can be found in [U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service: Data and Metrics](https://allison-bauman.quarto.pub/usda-ams-datametrics/). Code can also be found on the [FoodSystemsModeling Git Hub site](https://github.com/FoodSystemsModeling/DataWarehouse). This is not an active code base and we are not accepting contributions to the code. The code is made available for you to use in your own work if it is helpful.

All data associated with this project can be found in our [FAME Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/glpu4blo1y5qvfj/AAD3mc8jD1-VlIr47JVWF7sya?st=4qnsgs7f&dl=0). Data includes original data sets used and all final data that has been compiled (located in data_final). Links and description of the raw data are provided in the code files. Additional data from USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), not available publicly elsewhere, is also available in this folder.
